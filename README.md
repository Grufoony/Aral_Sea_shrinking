# Satellite Image Processing application to the shrinking Aral Sea
## Abstract
The aim of this project is to apply image processing techniques to satellite images in order to study a real-life phenomenon, the shrinking of the Aral Sea.
By applying the basis of image segmentation, we were able to quantify the shrinking ratio through time, thus obtaining a plot of its evolution through a 44-years timespan.
Moreover, by combining the edge detection technique with operations between more images we were also able to improve the visualization of this phenomenon through an animated GIF.
